# Using a Virtual Machine with Linux

[Daniel Trnka](https://github.com/trnila) was very kind and created a virtual image of Linux with Ubuntu 18.04. It's the same configuration as is our lab computers.

## Virtual image

Virual image is provided [here](http://mrl.cs.vsb.cz/data/upr/UPR.ova) in OVA format.

## How to open virtual image in the VirtualBox

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
2. Choose File -> Import Appliance...
3. Open up the UPR.ova file and setup the import (basically by accepting default options).
4. Run the virtual machine.
