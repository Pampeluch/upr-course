## Linux virtual machine

A virtual machine of Ubuntu Linux similar to lab computers is provided.
See [Linux virtual machine](./faq/vm.md) FAQ for instructions how to run it.


## Interesting Links

If you want to visualize small C programs, [Python Tutor for C](http://pythontutor.com/c.html) is a great tool. You can step though your programs and see how the memory is laid out and how its contents change.

[This missing semenster](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) is a cool site about tools and techniques that are mostly missing in CS education.
I really recommend to go though it if you want to be fluent in stuff around CS.


## Books

As always, search the Internet.
